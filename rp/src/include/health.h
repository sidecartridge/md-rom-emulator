 * Description: Device health: stack and heap high-water marks, crash
 *              and hang recovery through the watchdog, and the reset
 *              reason kept across the reboot. From md-devops' health.c
 *              (v1.1.0), with this app's phases.
 *
 *              The breadcrumb lives in watchdog scratch registers 0-3,
 *              which survive a watchdog reboot but not a power cycle.
 *              The SDK owns scratch 4-7.
 *
 *                scratch[0]  magic (8) | reason (4) | crash count (4) |
 *                            crash window s (8) | phase (8)
 *                scratch[1]  PC at the crash; while running, the stall
 *                            mark that tells a real hang from a probe reset
 *                scratch[2]  LR at the crash (HardFault only)
 *                scratch[3]  SP at the crash
